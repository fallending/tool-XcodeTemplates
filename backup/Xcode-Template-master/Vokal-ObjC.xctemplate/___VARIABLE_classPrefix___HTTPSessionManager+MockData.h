/**
 * Interface to provide methods for turning mock data on and off, using VOKMockUrlProtocol.
 *
 * Before this category can be used, you must do the following:
 *
 *   1. Add the VOKMockUrlProtocol pod to your Podfile. This only needs to be in
 *      the testing target(s).
 *   2. Add ___VARIABLE_classPrefix___HTTPSessionManager+MockData.m to your testing target(s). By default,
 *      it's not included in any targets: because VOKMockUrlProtocol is not
 *      included in the project template, this category would fail to build.
 *   3. In your tests, call switchToMockData in setup/beforeAll, and
 *      switchToLiveNetwork in teardown/afterAll to set it back.
